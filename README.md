# BASH Scripts
A comprehensive collection of all my bash scripts i've either made or copied. Most of them are useless, but none the less, interesting! 

# About
Shell scripts can be small or large tasks that are carried out by a shell designated by the user, in this case BASH. If you dont have a bash shell you cannot use these. This means that if you have to either install bash shell on your mac or distro of linux. Wont work with ZSH / DASH shell! 

# Installation
Using Git via Command line Interface:
  
    $ git clone https://github.com/underd0g1/BASH.git`


Once on your system, take ownership and make it executable:
  
    $ chmod 755 [shell_Script_name]`



To actually run the script after completing the above:
   
    $ ./shell_script_name`
